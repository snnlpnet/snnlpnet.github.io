There are many papers, notes and blog posts for explaining theories and mathmatical details of recurrent neural network language model (rnnlm). 
However, there are few notes aimed at how to implement a rnnlm step by step. 
Also at least implementing a recurrent neural network for a newbies is not very easy, especially when using a coding language like c/c++ instead of matlab. 
There are many tricks we need to pay attention to. 
After understanding this tricks,  we can borrow them into our future work. 
I chose a piece of implementation code **rnnlm-0.4b** to understand every corner in it for serveral weeks and I learned many useful experience from this implementation.
Therefore, this is a blog for some coding details in **rnnlm-0.4b**.
