I'm a first-year PhD student in [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)][SUTD].   
This is a personal blog for recording some notes related to my academic life, including deep learning, machine learning and natural langauge processing. Also I will contain some diaries to make this blog more intersting and more diverse.   

Your are always welcome to leave any comment. That will helps me keep blogging.

I Believe  
> God help those who help themselves.
